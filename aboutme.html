   <h2>About me</h2>

   <h4>I’m Beth and to quickly summarise the above timeline, I am adaptable and love to learn new things!<br><br>

   <h4>I was drawn to cyber as I think it moulds all of my interests and skills together; creativity, technology, problem solving and constantly learning new skills.<br><br>
      
      I must add, I am not a designer! as you can tell by this site, but I got carried away playing around on Adobe illustrator 
      – hopefully if you have read to this point, it didn’t put you off.   <br><br>
      
      In my current work life, I am a telesales coordinator, selling commercial laundry repairs to businesses, 
      I am a bookkeeper for a local Joinery company and also a personal trainer and gym instructor. On top of this, 
      one weekend a month I work for the RAF reserves. On a personal level, I collect and sell vinyl records, 
      I am addicted to completing online courses, I live on my own with my best friend, or a dog to most people… Otis.
      I love meeting new people and visiting new places. I am competitive and love a challenge, whether it’s testing
      my existing knowledge or adding strings to my bow.  <br><br>

     Over the past year on the course with Tech Talent Academy, I have surprised myself more than once. 
     When you struggle over one line of code for hours with only Google as your friend, to then see this come alive 
     on your screen when you figured out the one character that was out of place, and it works! I want this feeling all the time, satisfaction.
